# Flow problems with FEniCS

Files and codes of solving flow problems with FEniCS.


ToDo list:

- [ ] add channel flow test (periodic bcs and pressure gradient)
- [ ] add Couette flow test (component-wise boundary conditions)
- [ ] add Taylor-Green vortex
- [ ] modify computation of potential 
- [ ] add computation of the stream function
- [ ] add serialization and restart features
- [ ] simplify specification of boundary conditions


Milestones:
- [x] stationary lid-driven cavity
- [x] stationary gravity-driven pipe flow
- [ ] channel flow with periodic boundary conditions
- [ ] Couette flow
- [ ] instationary gravity-driven pipe flow
- [ ] DFG benchmark problem
- [ ] two-phase flow solver / breaking dam problem
