# Flow problems with FEniCS

## Two phase flow 
I only uploaded the code of Dambreak, and there is still a problem in the 'A droplet in dripping process' code. I will try to find the problem again. If I still canâ€™t find the problem, I will upload it too.

## Dam break result

## ToDo list:

- [ ] Modify the current codes
- [ ] According to Sebastian's codes structure, change my script program and write a simple N_S equation solver and a simple LevelSetFunction solver in an object-oriented structure, and can be called in the main program (As an exercise in object-oriented programming, start by modifying my own program).
- [ ] The physical equations in the program may need modify
- [ ] After the modification, find a dambreak benchmark for comparison 
- [ ] Simulate free-falling laminar jet
- [ ] Add electric field
